        <p>
          One of the main tasks facing the global food industry and grocery is
          to meet social expectations by increasing the amount of food nutrition
          information. Most companies in the European Union, including the trade
          partners outside EU, already provide nutrition information on food
          labels. This initiative goes beyond the requirements set out in legal
          regulations and is getting mandatory. <br /><br />

          Using our validator you can check what nutrition claims are available
          for your product and check all RDI values for product label. All
          calculations are based on EU nutrition and health claims made on food
          regulations -
